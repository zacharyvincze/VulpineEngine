# VulpineEngine

An in-development, 2D SDL game engine.

## Current Features

-   Entity-component-system for managing entities.
-   Parser for handling engine configuration and loading in data.
-   Basic sprite renderer.
-   Scene management for handling memory allocation and de-allocation of game objects.
-   Sprite definitions via JSON.

## Planned Features

-   Native C++ scripting for game objects.
-   Tile-based mapping engine.
-   General user input manager.
-   Physics system.
-   And more, although this is what I'm working on currently.
